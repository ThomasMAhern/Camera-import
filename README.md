# Camera-import
Capture One takes too long determining which Phase One photos to import, so I'm building script which focuses purely on copying/renaming them based on their creation date.

Now it also compares existing file sizes in both places to see if something went wonky in a previous import (and transfers those files as well).

takes XXXXX.IIQ file and copies/renames it to: ../ 2021 / 2021-01-01 / 2021-01-01_XXXXX.IIQ
